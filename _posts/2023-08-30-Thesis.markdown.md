I've been thinking about this for a while now. Any time I take a picture of the mole on my left wrist and compare it with the old images, the idea of having a tracker seems attractive. 

Creating an album in your gallery is a start but having instant access to even the trivial algorithms stitched for this one task of logging surface anatomy could provide significant value for the handful of people like me. There are plenty of dermatology tracking apps but the people who really want it are generally aversive to something they can't look into. Therefore an opensource & on-device solution makes sense to me.

I'll break it in 3 parts:
1. Recording
2. Retrieval
3. Compression

I am currently comparing the conventional descriptors with a few SoTA implementations of the COCO challenge to generate real time masks in recording.
